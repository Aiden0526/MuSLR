 Step 1: SR1

> FOL Rule:

$$
(P → (Q1 ∧ V2)) ∧ (R → S) ∧ (P ∨ R) ⊢ ((Q1 ∧ V2) ∨ S)
$$

Syllogism Format:

 Major premise:
  If there exists an article titled "Financial Market Update", then there exists an author with byline "John Doe" and an event named "Investor Conference".

  $$
  ∃x (Article(x) ∧ Title(x, 'Financial Market Update')) → (∃y (Author(y) ∧ Byline(y, 'John Doe')) ∧ ∃v (Event(v) ∧ Name(v, 'Investor Conference')))
  $$

  (from context)

 Minor premise:
  If Jane Smith is mentioned and discussed market trends, then there exists a report about quarterly earnings.

  $$
  ∃z (Person(z) ∧ Mentioned(z, 'Jane Smith') ∧ Discussed(z, 'Market Trends')) → ∃w (Report(w) ∧ Subject(w, 'Quarterly Earnings'))
  $$

  (from context)

 Auxiliary premise:
  Either there exists an article titled "Financial Market Update", or Jane Smith is mentioned and discussed market trends.

  $$
  ∃x (Article(x) ∧ Title(x, 'Financial Market Update')) ∨ ∃z (Person(z) ∧ Mentioned(z, 'Jane Smith') ∧ Discussed(z, 'Market Trends'))
  $$

  (from context)

 Conclusion:
  Either there exists an author named John Doe and an event called "Investor Conference", or there exists a report on "Quarterly Earnings".

  $$
  (∃y (Author(y) ∧ Byline(y, 'John Doe')) ∧ ∃v (Event(v) ∧ Name(v, 'Investor Conference'))) ∨ ∃w (Report(w) ∧ Subject(w, 'Quarterly Earnings'))
  $$

  (Step 1)

---

 Step 2: CR1 (Commonsense Reasoning)

> FOL Rule:

$$
(Q1 → V1) ∧ ¬V1 ⊢ ¬Q1
$$

Logic Format (Commonsense):

 Premise 1:
  If John Doe is the author of the article, then the article mentions a financial analyst who contributed "Market Insights".

  $$
  ∃y (Author(y) ∧ Byline(y, 'John Doe')) → ∃u (Person(u) ∧ Mentioned(u, 'Financial Analyst') ∧ Contribution(u, 'Market Insights'))
  $$

  (from commonsense)

 Premise 2:
  There is no mention of any financial analyst who contributed "Market Insights".

  $$
  ¬∃u (Person(u) ∧ Mentioned(u, 'Financial Analyst') ∧ Contribution(u, 'Market Insights'))
  $$

  (from image — absence of content)

 Conclusion:
  Therefore, John Doe is not the author of the article.

  $$
  ¬∃y (Author(y) ∧ Byline(y, 'John Doe'))
  $$

  (Step 2)

---

 Step 3: SR2

> FOL Rule:

$$
((Q1 ∧ V2) ∨ S) ∧ ¬(Q1 ∧ V2) ⊢ S
$$

Syllogism Format:

 Major premise:
  Either both John Doe is the author and the event is the "Investor Conference", or there exists a report on "Quarterly Earnings".

  $$
  (∃y (Author(y) ∧ Byline(y, 'John Doe')) ∧ ∃v (Event(v) ∧ Name(v, 'Investor Conference'))) ∨ ∃w (Report(w) ∧ Subject(w, 'Quarterly Earnings'))
  $$

  (from Step 1)

 Minor premise:
  It is not the case that both John Doe is the author and the event is "Investor Conference".

  $$
  ¬(∃y (Author(y) ∧ Byline(y, 'John Doe')) ∧ ∃v (Event(v) ∧ Name(v, 'Investor Conference')))
  $$

  (from Step 2 — John Doe is not the author)

 Conclusion:
  Therefore, there exists a report on "Quarterly Earnings".

  $$
  ∃w (Report(w) ∧ Subject(w, 'Quarterly Earnings'))
  $$

  (Step 3)

---

 Step 4: SR3

> FOL Rule:

$$
((S ∧ V3) → T) ∧ (S ∧ V3) ⊢ T
$$

Syllogism Format:

 Major premise:
  If there is a report on "Quarterly Earnings" and the place is New York, then a CEO is mentioned as involved in a company meeting.

  $$
  (∃w (Report(w) ∧ Subject(w, 'Quarterly Earnings')) ∧ ∃s (Place(s) ∧ Location(s, 'New York'))) → ∃t (Person(t) ∧ Mentioned(t, 'CEO') ∧ InvolvedIn(t, 'Company Meeting'))
  $$

  (from context)

 Minor premise:
  There is a report on "Quarterly Earnings" (from Step 3), and the place is New York.

  $$
  ∃w (Report(w) ∧ Subject(w, 'Quarterly Earnings')) ∧ ∃s (Place(s) ∧ Location(s, 'New York'))
  $$

  (report from Step 3, place from image → V3)

 Conclusion:
  Therefore, there exists a person who is a CEO and is mentioned as being involved in a company meeting.

  $$
  ∃t (Person(t) ∧ Mentioned(t, 'CEO') ∧ InvolvedIn(t, 'Company Meeting'))
  $$

  (Step 4)


---
Final Evaluation:

A.
$\text{It is false that } ∃t (Person(t) ∧ Mentioned(t, 'CEO') ∧ InvolvedIn(t, 'Company Meeting'))$
❌ Contradicts the conclusion of SR3, which affirms the existence of such a CEO.

---

B.
$∃t (Person(t) ∧ Mentioned(t, 'CEO') ∧ InvolvedIn(t, 'Company very potbellied Meeting'))$
❌ Invalid predicate; “Company very potbellied Meeting” is a malformed or nonsensical phrase and not supported by any context or commonsense.

---

C.
$∃t (Person(t) ∧ Mentioned(t, 'CEO') ∧ InvolvedIn(t, 'Company Meeting'))$
✅ Correct — directly derived in SR3, based on a report about “Quarterly Earnings” located in “New York”.

---

D.
$\text{It is false that } ∃w (Report(w) ∧ Subject(w, 'Quarterly Earnings'))$
❌ Contradicted by SR2, which confirms the existence of such a report.

---

 ✅ Final Answer: C

Answer: {C}

Example:

Image: <IMAGE2>

Context:
1.
$$
Speeding(Vehicle) → SafeDistance(Maintained)
$$

2.
$$
SafeDistance(Maintained) → TrafficLaw(Complied)
$$

3.
$$
Speeding(Vehicle) ∨ ¬TrafficLaw(Complied)
$$

4.
$$
EmergencyBraking(Activated) → SafeDistance(Maintained)
$$

5.
$$
Accident(Avoided) → EmergencyBraking(Activated)
$$


Question:
Given the image and context, please determine whether the below argument is True, False, or Unknown: Accident(Avoided).


Syllogistic Reasoning Chain:

 Step 1: SR1

$$
(P → ¬V1) ∧ (R → S) ∧ (P ∨ ¬S) ⊢ (¬V1 ∨ ¬R)
$$

Substituted Reasoning:

 Major premise:
  If a vehicle is speeding, then it is not the case that there exists a vehicle on the road.

  $$
  Speeding(Vehicle) → ¬∃x (Vehicle(x) ∧ OnRoad(x))
  $$

  (from context)

 Minor premise:
  If a safe distance is maintained, then traffic laws are complied with.

  $$
  SafeDistance(Maintained) → TrafficLaw(Complied)
  $$

  (from context)

 Auxiliary premise:
  Either the vehicle is speeding, or traffic laws are not complied with.

  $$
  Speeding(Vehicle) ∨ ¬TrafficLaw(Complied)
  $$

  (from context)

 Conclusion:
  Therefore, either no vehicle is on the road, or a safe distance is not maintained.

  $$
  ¬∃x (Vehicle(x) ∧ OnRoad(x)) ∨ ¬SafeDistance(Maintained)
  $$

  (Step 1)

---

 Step 2: SR2

$$
(¬V1 ∨ ¬R) ∧ V1 ⊢ ¬R
$$

Substituted Reasoning:

 Major premise:
  Either there is no vehicle on the road, or a safe distance is not maintained.

  $$
  ¬∃x (Vehicle(x) ∧ OnRoad(x)) ∨ ¬SafeDistance(Maintained)
  $$

  (from Step 1)

 Minor premise:
  There is a vehicle on the road.

  $$
  ∃x (Vehicle(x) ∧ OnRoad(x))
  $$

  (from image)

 Conclusion:
  Therefore, a safe distance is not maintained.

  $$
  ¬SafeDistance(Maintained)
  $$

  (Step 2)

---

 Step 3: CR1 (Commonsense Reasoning)

$$
(R1 → R) ∧ ¬R ⊢ ¬R1
$$

Substituted Reasoning:

 Major premise:
  If driver attention is required, then a safe distance will be maintained.

  $$
  DriverAttention(Required) → SafeDistance(Maintained)
  $$

  (from commonsense)

 Minor premise:
  A safe distance is not maintained.

  $$
  ¬SafeDistance(Maintained)
  $$

  (from Step 2)

 Conclusion:
  Therefore, driver attention is not being given.

  $$
  ¬DriverAttention(Required)
  $$

  (Step 3)

---

 Step 4: SR3

$$
(T → (R1 ∧ V2)) ∧ ¬(R1 ∧ V2) ⊢ ¬T
$$

Substituted Reasoning:

 Major premise:
  If emergency braking is activated, then driver attention is required and a steering wheel exists in front of the driver.

  $$
  EmergencyBraking(Activated) → (DriverAttention(Required) ∧ ∃x (SteeringWheel(x) ∧ InFrontOfDriver(x)))
  $$

  (from context)

 Minor premise:
  It is not the case that both driver attention is required and a steering wheel is in front of the driver.

  $$
  ¬(DriverAttention(Required) ∧ ∃x (SteeringWheel(x) ∧ InFrontOfDriver(x)))
  $$

  (from Step 3 + image)

 Conclusion:
  Therefore, emergency braking is not activated.

  $$
  ¬EmergencyBraking(Activated)
  $$

  (Step 4)

---

 Step 5: CR2 (Commonsense Reasoning)

$$
(T1 → T) ∧ ¬T ⊢ ¬T1
$$

Substituted Reasoning:

 Major premise:
  If immediate action is necessary, then emergency braking is activated.

  $$
  ImmediateAction(Necessary) → EmergencyBraking(Activated)
  $$

  (from commonsense)

 Minor premise:
  Emergency braking is not activated.

  $$
  ¬EmergencyBraking(Activated)
  $$

  (from Step 4)

 Conclusion:
  Therefore, immediate action is not necessary.

  $$
  ¬ImmediateAction(Necessary)
  $$

  (Step 5)

---

 Step 6: SR4

$$
(U → (T1 ∧ V3)) ∧ ¬(T1 ∧ V3) ⊢ ¬U
$$

Substituted Reasoning:

 Major premise:
  If an accident is avoided, then immediate action is necessary and a mirror reflects the rear view.

  $$
  Accident(Avoided) → (ImmediateAction(Necessary) ∧ ∃x (Mirror(x) ∧ ReflectsRearView(x)))
  $$

  (from context)

 Minor premise:
  It is not the case that immediate action is necessary and a rear-view mirror is reflecting.

  $$
  ¬(ImmediateAction(Necessary) ∧ ∃x (Mirror(x) ∧ ReflectsRearView(x)))
  $$

  (from Step 5 + image)

 Conclusion:
  Therefore, an accident is not avoided.

  $$
  ¬Accident(Avoided)
  $$

  (Step 6)

---
Final evaluation:
The reasoning chain deductively leads to ¬Accident(Avoided). Thus, the statment of "Accident(Avoided)" is false.
Answer: {False}
